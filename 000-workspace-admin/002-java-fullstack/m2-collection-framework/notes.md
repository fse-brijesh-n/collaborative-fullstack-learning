## Collection Framework 

The Collection Framework in Java is a unified architecture for storing and manipulating groups of objects. It provides a
set of interfaces and classes that implement them, catering to various data structures and algorithms.

### Basics of Collection Framework

#### 1. **Core Interfaces**

- **What is the `Collection` interface in Java?**  
  The `Collection` interface is the root interface of the Collection Framework. It provides a unified architecture for
  storing and manipulating groups of objects. Subinterfaces of `Collection` include `List`, `Set`, and `Queue`.

- **What are the differences between `List`, `Set`, and `Queue`?**
  - `List`: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Examples include `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`.
  - `Set`: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Examples include `HashSet`, `TreeSet`.
  - `Queue`: A collection used to hold elements prior to processing, often ordered by priority. Examples include
    `PriorityQueue`, `LinkedList`.

- **What is the `Map` interface and how is it different from `Collection`?**  
  The `Map` interface represents a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. Unlike `Collection`, it does
  not extend the `Collection` interface. Examples include `HashMap`, `TreeMap`.

- **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `Vector`?**  
  `ArrayList` is not synchronized, making it faster but not thread-safe. `Vector`, on the other hand, is synchronized,
  offering thread safety at the cost of performance.

- **What is the difference between `HashSet` and `TreeSet`?**  
  `HashSet` is based on a hash table and does not guarantee any order of elements. `TreeSet` is based on a tree
  structure and provides elements in sorted (natural or custom) order.

- **How does `HashMap` handle collisions?**  
  `HashMap` uses a technique called chaining. It stores multiple elements in a single bucket using a linked list or,
  since Java 8, a balanced tree for improved performance when many collisions occur.

- **What are the differences between `Array` and `ArrayList`?**
  - `Array` is a fixed-size data structure, while `ArrayList` is resizable.
  - `Array` can hold both primitive data types and objects, whereas `ArrayList` can only hold objects.
  - `ArrayList` provides more flexibility and operations (e.g., dynamic resizing, element insertion).

- **Why should you override the `hashCode` and `equals` methods?**  
  These methods are used to determine equality for objects stored in hash-based collections (`HashMap`, `HashSet`).
  Failing to override these methods consistently can lead to data integrity issues, such as duplicate entries in
  `HashSet` or unexpected behavior in `HashMap`.

- **What is the difference between `fail-fast` and `fail-safe` iterators?**
  - `Fail-fast`: Throws a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified while iterating (e.g.,
    `ArrayList`, `HashMap`).
  - `Fail-safe`: Allows modifications during iteration by working on a clone of the collection (e.g.,
    `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `ConcurrentHashMap`).

- **What are bulk operations in the Collection Framework?**  
  These are operations that perform actions in bulk, such as `addAll()`, `removeAll()`, `retainAll()`, and `clear()`.
#### 2. **Key Classes**

- **When would you use `ArrayList` over `LinkedList`?**  
  Use `ArrayList` for fast random access and if frequent modifications are not required. Use `LinkedList` for scenarios
  requiring frequent insertions and deletions.

- **What is a `HashSet` and how does it ensure uniqueness?**  
  A `HashSet` is a hash table-based implementation of the `Set` interface that uses a hash code to ensure uniqueness of
  elements.

- **What is the purpose of a `PriorityQueue`?**  
  A `PriorityQueue` is a queue that orders elements based on their priority. It is typically implemented using a heap
  data structure.

#### 3. **Advantages**

- **Why should you use the Collection Framework?**
  - It reduces programming effort by providing ready-made data structures.
  - Enhances performance due to optimized and tested code.
  - Increases code maintainability by adhering to consistent design patterns.

### Advanced Concepts

#### 1. **NavigableMap and NavigableSet**

- **What is the purpose of `NavigableMap` and `NavigableSet`?**  
  These interfaces provide additional navigation methods like `lower()`, `higher()`, `ceiling()`, and `floor()` for
  searching and traversal within a range.

#### 2. **Concurrency in Collections**

- **What are the thread-safe alternatives to collections in Java?**
  - Synchronized Wrappers: `Collections.synchronizedList()` or `Collections.synchronizedMap()` for basic thread
    safety.
  - Concurrent Collections: `ConcurrentHashMap` (efficient concurrent map) or `CopyOnWriteArrayList` (read-optimized
    threadsafe list).

- **What is the difference between `ConcurrentHashMap` and `HashMap`?**
  - `HashMap` is not thread-safe whereas `ConcurrentHashMap` allows concurrent access without locking the entire map.

#### 3. **Stream API**

- **How does the Stream API simplify collection processing?**  
  It allows functional-style operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing. For example:
  ```java
  list.stream()
      .filter(s -> s.startsWith("A"))
      .map(String::toUpperCase)
      .forEach(System.out::println);
  ```

#### 4. **Custom Implementations**

- **How do you create a custom collection?**  
  You can extend abstract classes such as `AbstractList`, `AbstractSet`, or directly implement collection interfaces
  while defining all mandatory methods.

#### 5. **Generics**

- **What are the benefits of using Generics in collections?**
  - Ensures compile-time type safety.
  - Eliminates the need for casting while retrieving elements.
  - Avoids runtime `ClassCastException`.

### Comparison of Collection Types:

| Feature                | List               | Set                 | Queue                     | Map                       |
|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Duplicates Allowed** | Yes                | No                  | Varies                    | Keys: No, Values: Yes     |
| **Ordered**            | Yes (List based)   | No                  | Yes                       | Based on Implementation   |
| **Performance**        | Fast random access | Fast unique lookups | Depends on implementation | Depends on Implementation |

#### FAQs on Collection Types:

- **Can a `Set` contain duplicate elements?**  
  No, `Set` does not allow duplicates. If an element is added that is already present, it overwrites the existing
  element.

- **What kind of ordering does a `TreeSet` provide?**  
  A `TreeSet` provides elements in a natural sorted order (or according to a custom comparator).

### Thread Safety in Collections:

| Feature             | Synchronized                               | Concurrent                                       |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Example Classes** | Vector, Hashtable                          | ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList          |
| **Use Case**        | Small apps requiring basic synchronization | Applications requiring efficient multi-threading |

#### FAQs on Thread Safety:

- **What are the disadvantages of synchronized collections?**  
  They tend to be slow due to the overhead of locking, especially in highly concurrent applications. Using concurrent
  utilities like `ConcurrentHashMap` often improves performance.

- **When should you use `CopyOnWriteArrayList`?**  
  Use it when the number of reads greatly outnumbers writes, such as caching scenarios or event listener lists.

### Algorithms Provided in Collections

- **What algorithms are provided by the `Collections` utility class?**
  - **Sorting**: Sorts elements using their natural order or a provided comparator.
  - **Searching**: Performs binary search on sorted collections.
  - **Shuffling**: Randomizes the order of elements.
  - **Reversing**: Reverses the order of elements.

#### Code Examples:

1. **Sorting**:
   ```java
   Collections.sort(list);
   ```
2. **Searching**:
   ```java
   int index = Collections.binarySearch(list, "key");
   ```
3. **Reversing**:
   ```java
   Collections.reverse(list);
   ```
4. **Shuffling**:
   ```java
   Collections.shuffle(list);
   ```

### Summary:

The Collection Framework offers standardized, efficient ways to manipulate, navigate, and store data, covering
everything from beginner-friendly `List`, `Set`, and `Map` collections to advanced concurrency utilities and custom
implementations.

494:474:  - It avoids contention by having each thread maintain its own random generator.

495:475:85. **What is an `ImmutableMap` in Java?**  
496:476:  - `ImmutableMap` is used to create a map that cannot be modified after initialization.  
497:477:  - Provided by libraries like Guava and now supported natively in recent Java versions.

498:478:86. **How does `Collectors.toConcurrentMap()` work?**  
499:479:  - It collects elements into a concurrent map for thread-safe storage.  
500:480:  - Example: Managing a map in a multithreaded environment.

501:481:87. **Explain `Collectors.summingInt()` and its use case.**  
502:482:  - `summingInt()` calculates the sum of integer values from elements in a stream.  
503:483:  - Useful in scenarios like calculating total salaries from employee objects.

504:484:88. **What is a `Stream.Builder`?**  
505:485:  - `Stream.Builder` provides a way to construct a stream programmatically by adding elements explicitly.  
506:486:  - Example: Creating a stream on the fly with unknown elements.

507:487:89. **What is `Properties` class in Java, and its purpose?**  
508:488:  - `Properties` is used to store configuration data as key-value pairs, typically in `.properties` files.  
509:489:  - Commonly used for application settings and localization.

510:490:90. **Explain the difference between `Optional.empty()` and `Optional.ofNullable()`.**  
511:491:  - `Optional.empty()` explicitly represents a missing value.  
512:492:  - `Optional.ofNullable()` creates an `Optional`, which can either contain a value or be empty.

513:493:91. **What is `Collectors.joining()` in streams?**  
514:494:  - `Collectors.joining()` concatenates strings from a stream into a single string.  
515:495:  - Example: Joining names with a delimiter, like `", "`.

516:496:92. **What is the role of `Comparator.comparing()` in sorting?**  
517:497:  - `Comparator.comparing()` is a functional-style way to create comparators based on object properties.  
518:498:  - Example: Sorting employees by their salaries.

519:499:93. **What is the use case for `BitSet` in Java?**  
520:500:  - `BitSet` is used to manipulate sets of bits efficiently, often for flags or bit-level operations.  
521:501:  - Example: Representing a set of integers.

522:502:94. **What is the significance of `Collectors.collectingAndThen()`?**  
523:503:  - It allows applying a collector and then transforming its result.  
524:504:  - Example: Creating an unmodifiable list after collecting elements.

525:505:95. **Explain the difference between `isPresent()` and `ifPresent()` in `Optional`.**  
526:506:  - `isPresent()` checks whether a value is present in the `Optional`.  
527:507:  - `ifPresent()` performs an action if a value is present.

528:508:96. **What is the purpose of `ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()`?**  
529:509:  - `newKeySet()` creates a thread-safe set backed by a `ConcurrentHashMap`.  
530:510:  - Useful for managing unique elements in a concurrent environment.

531:511:97. **How does Java handle default methods in interfaces for collections?**  
532:512:  - Default methods allow adding new functionalities to interfaces while maintaining backward compatibility.  
533:513:  - Example: `List.sort()` and `Stream.forEach()` methods.

534:514:98. **What is `Collectors.reducing()` and its use case?**  
535:515:  - `reducing()` performs reduction operations on elements in a stream using an accumulator.  
536:516:  - Example: Calculating the maximum or minimum from a stream.

537:517:99. **What is the use of `@SafeVarargs` in Java Collections?**  
538:518:  - `@SafeVarargs` suppresses warnings when using varargs with generic types.  
539:519:  - Commonly used in helper methods.

540:520:100. **What is a `ThreadSafeList` in Java? How can it be created?**  
541:521:  - Thread-safe lists can be created using `Collections.synchronizedList()` or implementations like
`CopyOnWriteArrayList`.
542:522:101. **What is the purpose of `Map.of()` and `Map.ofEntries()`?**  
543:523:  - `Map.of()` is used to create an immutable map with up to 10 key-value pairs.  
544:524:  - `Map.ofEntries()` enables creating larger immutable maps with `Map.Entry` objects.  
545:525:  - Both methods are useful for concise initialization of immutable maps.
